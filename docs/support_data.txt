Each file begins with a YAML-like header:
---

audience: ...
tags: [...]

Loader Hints
- Chunk size: 200–400 tokens with 20–40% overlap. Keep steps and tables intact.
- Index hybrid: BM25 + dense embeddings, then cross-encoder reranker.
- Return citations as file + section/line hint (use headings/bullets as anchors).

Evaluation
- Use data/eval_qna_goldset.txt for recall@k, MRR, citation accuracy, and refusal correctness on unanswerable.

Change Management
- Add new releases as data/synapse_release_notes_YYYY_MM.txt
- Update firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt and increment version in headers.
