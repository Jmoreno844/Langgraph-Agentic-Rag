Issue
The drone is not connecting or frequently disconnects from the remote controller.

Step 1 — Power and Proximity
- Ensure drone and controller are ≥50% battery.
- Keep within 1–3 m during initial linking; avoid obstacles between devices.

Step 2 — RF Interference Check
- Move at least 20 m away from Wi‑Fi APs, power lines, cellular towers.
- Disable phone hotspot/nearby hotspots during linking.

Step 3 — Band and Region Settings
- Confirm controller region is correct (2.4 GHz in CE regions; 2.4/5.8 GHz in FCC where allowed).
- Switch bands (2.4 ↔ 5.8 GHz) and channels to find a clearer spectrum.

Step 4 — Re-Linking Procedure
1. Power on both devices.
2. Controller: Settings > Linking > Start Linking.
3. Aircraft: Press and hold pairing button for 3 seconds until beep.
4. Wait for “Linking Successful.” If it fails, retry after power cycle.

Step 5 — LED and On-Screen Indicators
- Controller link icon blinking red: Not linked.
- Solid green: Strong link; yellow: degraded link; red: lost link.
- Aircraft status LED fast yellow flash: Linking mode; slow red flash: low signal.

Step 6 — Firmware and App Versions
- Verify versions against firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt.
- If mismatched, update controller app first, then aircraft firmware.

Step 7 — Antenna and Hardware
- Ensure antennas are fully extended and oriented perpendicular to the aircraft line-of-sight.
- Inspect connectors for damage; try a known-good cable if using wired link.

Step 8 — Diagnostics and Logs
- Controller: Settings > Diagnostics > Spectrum Analyzer (check noise floor).
- Export logs: Settings > Diagnostics > Export Logs and attach to support case.

Escalation
If the above fails, perform a factory reset (Settings > System > Reset), re-link, and test in a different location. Contact support with serial numbers and logs.
