Issue
The PC powers on but does not show a display or complete POST.

Step 1 — Power and Cables
- Ensure PSU is switched on; 24-pin ATX and 8-pin (or 8+4) EPS CPU power connected.
- Connect PCIe power to GPU (12VHPWR or 8-pin PCIe as applicable) until fully seated.

Step 2 — Monitor & Video Outputs
- Test with a known-good cable/monitor; try motherboard HDMI/DP when using iGPU.
- For dedicated GPUs, use GPU outputs only; disable integrated graphics if needed.

Step 3 — Memory Seating
- Install a single RAM module in the recommended slot (per manual).
- Reseat memory; try alternate slot and clear CMOS.

Step 4 — GPU and Storage
- Reseat the GPU; ensure it clicks into the PCIe slot.
- Temporarily disconnect all storage and USB devices except keyboard.

Step 5 — BIOS and Compatibility
- Update to the latest BIOS using Flashback (if supported) or with a compatible CPU.
- Verify CPU, motherboard, and RAM against firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt and vendor QVL.

Step 6 — Beep/LED Codes
- Reference motherboard Q-LEDs or beep codes; see troubleshooting_error_codes.txt for common meanings.

Step 7 — Minimal Boot
- Test motherboard outside the case on a non-conductive surface.
- Boot with CPU + 1x RAM + GPU (if no iGPU) only. Add components one by one.

Escalation
If issues persist, open a support case with full build list, serial numbers, photos, and a short video of power-on behavior.
