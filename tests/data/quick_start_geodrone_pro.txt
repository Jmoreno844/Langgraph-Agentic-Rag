Before You Begin
- Verify battery levels for drone and controller are at least 50%.
- Install or update the Synapse app on the controller (see firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt).
- Choose an open outdoor area, away from RF interference.

Unbox and Charge
1. Inspect contents: aircraft, controller, batteries, props, charger, cables.
2. Charge batteries to 100% using the included charger. LEDs turn solid when full.

Pair the Drone and Controller
1. Power on controller, then the drone.
2. On controller: Settings > Linking > Start Linking.
3. On aircraft: Press and hold the pairing button near the SD slot for 3 seconds until beep.
4. Controller displays “Linking Successful.” If not, see troubleshooting_connectivity.txt.

Pre-Flight Checklist
- Props installed and secure; no damage.
- GPS lock achieved (≥12 satellites) and Home Point set.
- IMU and compass status: Normal.
- Flight mode: P-Mode; Return-To-Home altitude set above local obstacles.

First Flight
1. Takeoff: Auto takeoff or manual throttle up to 2 m hover.
2. Controls: Practice gentle roll/pitch/yaw; keep line of sight.
3. Landing: Return over flat area; descend slowly; motors auto-stop on touchdown.

Capture Data
- Photo: Tap shutter; ensure subject is centered and in focus.
- Video: Start/stop recording; monitor remaining storage on SD.
- For inspections: Use 2–4x zoom; avoid digital zoom beyond 4x for clarity.

Upload to Synapse
1. Connect controller to internet (Wi‑Fi/Ethernet).
2. Synapse > Projects > Upload; select media from SD or internal storage.
3. Choose processing (photogrammetry, defect detection) and submit.

Troubleshooting Quick Checks
- No link: Verify battery >50%, reduce distance to 1–3 m, move away from Wi‑Fi routers.
- Drift: Perform IMU and compass calibration in open area.
- Shaky video: Check prop balance and gimbal lock removed.

Support
- If issues persist, collect logs (Settings > Diagnostics > Export Logs) and contact support with serial number.
