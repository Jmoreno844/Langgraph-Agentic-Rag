Imagine RAM mis-seated or GPU not fully seated; how would no-POST be diagnosed?,"To diagnose no-POST when RAM might be mis-seated or the GPU not fully seated, follow a focused minimal-boot approach:

- RAM seating
  - Power off, unplug, reseat each RAM module firmly in the recommended slot(s). If you have multiple sticks, test one at a time in the recommended slot, then try alternate slots.
  - Clear CMOS between tests.
  - Try a minimal memory configuration: one CPU, 1 RAM module in the recommended slot (per manual).
  - If still no POST, verify RAM compatibility with the motherboard (firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt and vendor QVL).

- GPU seating
  - Power off, unplug, reseat the GPU until it clicks into the PCIe slot and reconnect any PCIe power cables.
  - If available, try a different PCIe slot.
  - For setups with an iGPU, test with motherboard video outputs only if you’re not using a discrete GPU; otherwise use the GPU outputs.

- Minimal boot and isolation
  - Boot with CPU + 1 RAM + GPU (if no iGPU) and no other drives/USB devices; add components one by one if POST occurs.
  - Check motherboard Q-LEDs or beep codes for specific diagnostics (refer to troubleshooting_error_codes.txt).

- BIOS/compatibility check
  - If issues persist, update BIOS via Flashback or with a compatible CPU, and recheck against firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt and QVL.

- If still unresolved
  - Escalate with a full build list, serials, photos, and a short power-on video for support.","['---\ntitle: Troubleshooting — No POST / No Display\ndoc_type: troubleshooting\nversion: 1.0\neffective_date: 2025-08-19\nproduct: PC Components\naudience: End Users, Support Agents\ntags: [build, post, diagnostics]\n---\n\nIssue\nThe PC powers on but does not show a display or complete POST.\n\nStep 1 — Power and Cables\n- Ensure PSU is switched on; 24-pin ATX and 8-pin (or 8+4) EPS CPU power connected.\n- Connect PCIe power to GPU (12VHPWR or 8-pin PCIe as applicable) until fully seated.\n\nStep 2 — Monitor & Video Outputs\n- Test with a known-good cable/monitor; try motherboard HDMI/DP when using iGPU.\n- For dedicated GPUs, use GPU outputs only; disable integrated graphics if needed.\n\nStep 3 — Memory Seating\n- Install a single RAM module in the recommended slot (per manual).\n- Reseat memory; try alternate slot and clear CMOS.\n\nStep 4 — GPU and Storage\n- Reseat the GPU; ensure it clicks into the PCIe slot.\n- Temporarily disconnect all storage and USB devices except keyboard.\n\nStep 5 — BIOS and Compatibility\n- Update to the latest BIOS using Flashback (if supported) or with a compatible CPU.\n- Verify CPU, motherboard, and RAM against firmware_compatibility_matrix.txt and vendor QVL.\n\nStep 6 — Beep/LED Codes\n- Reference motherboard Q-LEDs or beep codes; see troubleshooting_error_codes.txt for common meanings.\n\nStep 7 — Minimal Boot\n- Test motherboard outside the case on a non-conductive surface.\n- Boot with CPU + 1x RAM + GPU (if no iGPU) only.

"Explain Code 55 and deduce triage steps: single-stick in preferred slot, reseat, try other DIMM.","Code 55 means Memory Not Installed/Detected due to slot usage or seating issues.

Triage steps:
- Install a single RAM stick in the motherboard’s preferred slot and power on.
- Reseat the RAM: power off, unplug, remove, and firmly reinsert the module to ensure it’s fully seated.
- Try another DIMM (alternate stick) in the same slot to determine if the issue is a faulty module.","['---\ntitle: Error Codes Reference — Motherboard POST\ndoc_type: reference\nversion: 1.0\neffective_date: 2025-08-19\nproduct: PC Components\naudience: End Users, Support Agents\ntags: [errors, diagnostics]\n---\n\nCode 55 — Memory Not Installed/Detected\n- Symptom: DRAM LED lit; no display.\n- Cause: Incorrect slot usage or poor seating.\n- Resolution: Install a single stick in the preferred slot; reseat or try alternate stick.\n\nCode A2 — IDE Detect / Storage Init\n- Symptom: Hangs at logo; no boot device found.\n- Cause: Drive or cable issue; incorrect boot order.\n- Resolution: Reseat data/power cables; set correct boot device; test with one drive.\n\nCPU LED Solid — CPU Error\n- Symptom: No POST; fans spin.\n- Cause: Missing 8-pin/EPS, bent socket pins, incompatible BIOS.\n- Resolution: Verify EPS power, inspect socket (Intel), update BIOS.\n\nVGA LED Solid — GPU Error\n- Symptom: No display output from GPU.\n- Cause: GPU not fully seated or insufficient power.\n- Resolution: Reseat GPU; check PCIe/12VHPWR connections; test alternate slot.\n\nBoot LED Solid — Boot Device Error\n- Symptom: Enters BIOS; OS not loading.\n- Cause: No OS or wrong boot mode.\n- Resolution: Set UEFI mode; select OS drive; repair bootloader if needed.

Outline step-by-step GPU error triage for VGA LED solid on [Make/Model] mobo","GPU error triage for VGA LED solid on [Make/Model] motherboard

- Confirm: VGA LED solid = GPU error; symptom is no display output from GPU.
- Step 1: Power off and unplug. Re-seat the GPU in the PCIe x16 slot until it’s firmly seated.
- Step 2: Check PCIe power connections. Ensure all PCIe power cables (6/8-pin and/or 12VHPWR) are securely connected and cables/pins are undamaged.
- Step 3: If available, try the GPU in an alternate PCIe slot to rule out a faulty slot.
- Step 4: If possible, test with an alternate GPU to determine if the issue is the GPU vs. motherboard/PSU.

If the issue persists after these steps, further diagnostics or component testing may be required.","['---\ntitle: Error Codes Reference — Motherboard POST\ndoc_type: reference\nversion: 1.0\neffective_date: 2025-08-19\nproduct: PC Components\naudience: End Users, Support Agents\ntags: [errors, diagnostics]\n---\n\nCode 55 — Memory Not Installed/Detected\n- Symptom: DRAM LED lit; no display.\n- Cause: Incorrect slot usage or poor seating.\n- Resolution: Install a single stick in the preferred slot; reseat or try alternate stick.\n\nCode A2 — IDE Detect / Storage Init\n- Symptom: Hangs at logo; no boot device found.\n- Cause: Drive or cable issue; incorrect boot order.\n- Resolution: Reseat data/power cables; set correct boot device; test with one drive.\n\nCPU LED Solid — CPU Error\n- Symptom: No POST; fans spin.\n- Cause: Missing 8-pin/EPS, bent socket pins, incompatible BIOS.\n- Resolution: Verify EPS power, inspect socket (Intel), update BIOS.\n\nVGA LED Solid — GPU Error\n- Symptom: No display output from GPU.\n- Cause: GPU not fully seated or insufficient power.\n- Resolution: Reseat GPU; check PCIe/12VHPWR connections; test alternate slot.\n\nBoot LED Solid — Boot Device Error\n- Symptom: Enters BIOS; OS not loading.\n- Cause: No OS or wrong boot mode.\n- Resolution: Set UEFI mode; select OS drive; repair bootloader if needed.

"Provide L1–L3 escalation with triggers L1→L2/complex hw; L2→L3/vendor issues; actions, criteria, info, roles; SLA; format.","Here is a concise L1–L3 escalation framework using the provided policy.

Tr triggers
- L1 → L2: Complex compatibility issues or confirmed hardware issues.
- L2 → L3: Vendor RMAs, logistics problems, or urgent order/payment incidents.

Roles
- L1 (Frontline Support): Triage, handle Level 1 scope (order status, account issues, basic how-to), collect data, initiate escalation when triggers are met.
- L2 (Product Specialists: CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Memory, Storage, PSU): Diagnose complex hardware/compatibility, confirm hardware fault, compile required data, decide if L3 is needed.
- L3 (Operations & Vendor Escalation): Manage vendor RMAs, logistics, and urgent order/payment incidents; coordinate with vendors and finalize resolution.

Data to collect (for any escalation)
- Customer: name, company, region, primary contact
- Case/Order: case number, order number, invoice/RMA number
- Product details: SKU, vendor, part numbers, serial numbers, firmware, configuration
- Symptoms: description, error codes, steps to reproduce, logs, screenshots
- Timeline: key dates, last successful/failed attempt
- Impact/Urgency: business impact, deadline, any escalated timeline
- Attachments: photos, logs, screenshots

Actions by level
- L1 actions:
  - Triage to confirm scope; perform basic checks
  - If triggers are present, escalate to L2 with a concise summary and collected data
  - Communicate target channel and ETA to the customer
- L2 actions:
  - Perform hardware/compatibility deep-dive with product specialists
  - Validate whether issue is hardware/compatibility; gather missing data if needed
  - If vendor RMAs, logistics, or urgent order/payments are involved, prepare escalation package for L3 and initiate handoff
  - Provide a clear interim status to the customer
- L3 actions:
  - Engage vendor for RMAs, coordinate logistics, or address urgent order/payment incidents
  - Expedite replacements, shipments, or payment resolutions as applicable
  - Update customer, close the case, and capture final resolution details
