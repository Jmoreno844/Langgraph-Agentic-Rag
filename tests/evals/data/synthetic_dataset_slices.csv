- Confirm: VGA LED solid = GPU error; symptom is no display output from GPU.
- Step 1: Power off and unplug. Re-seat the GPU in the PCIe x16 slot until it’s firmly seated.
- Step 2: Check PCIe power connections. Ensure all PCIe power cables (6/8-pin and/or 12VHPWR) are securely connected and cables/pins are undamaged.
- Step 3: If available, try the GPU in an alternate PCIe slot to rule out a faulty slot.
- Step 4: If possible, test with an alternate GPU to determine if the issue is the GPU vs. motherboard/PSU.

Tr triggers
- L1 → L2: Complex compatibility issues or confirmed hardware issues.
- L2 → L3: Vendor RMAs, logistics problems, or urgent order/payment incidents.

- L1 (Frontline Support): Triage, handle Level 1 scope (order status, account issues, basic how-to), collect data, initiate escalation when triggers are met.
- L2 (Product Specialists: CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Memory, Storage, PSU): Diagnose complex hardware/compatibility, confirm hardware fault, compile required data, decide if L3 is needed.
- L3 (Operations & Vendor Escalation): Manage vendor RMAs, logistics, and urgent order/payment incidents; coordinate with vendors and finalize resolution.

Data to collect (for any escalation)
- Customer: name, company, region, primary contact
- Case/Order: case number, order number, invoice/RMA number
- Product details: SKU, vendor, part numbers, serial numbers, firmware, configuration
- Symptoms: description, error codes, steps to reproduce, logs, screenshots
- Timeline: key dates, last successful/failed attempt
- Impact/Urgency: business impact, deadline, any escalated timeline
- Attachments: photos, logs, screenshots

Actions by level

  - If triggers are present, escalate to L2 with a concise summary and collected data
  - Communicate target channel and ETA to the customer
- L2 actions:
